                        <div>
                            <p>This project explores modern cybersecurity threats to national defence. It focuses on essential tools like firewalls, antiviruses, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), network switches, and VPNs, examining how these technologies are selected, deployed, and certified to ensure robust and resilient national security infrastructure.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the face of increasing cyberattacks targeting critical government systems, military networks, and national data centers, the project aims to assess both technical capabilities and security compliance of core network components. It delves into the operational principles of these tools, evaluates their effectiveness against real-world threats, and highlights international certification standards like FIPS 140-2, Common Criteria, and NIST guidelines that validate their readiness for high-assurance environments.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through a combination of technical analysis, security criteria evaluation, and use-case reviews, this project contributes to a better understanding of how nations can build secure, scalable, and future-ready cyber defences in the digital age.</p>

                    <h3>What is a Network Switch?</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>switch</strong> is a networking device that connects devices within a LAN (Local Area Network) and intelligently forwards data to the correct destination using MAC addresses. It operates at <strong>Layer 2 (Data Link)</strong> or <strong>Layer 3 (Network)</strong> of the OSI model, enabling efficient, high-speed communication.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>How Switches Work</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Receives Data:</strong> A switch gets data packets from connected devices (computers, printers, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>Checks MAC Address:</strong> Identifies the destination device's MAC address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forwards Data:</strong> Sends the packet only to the intended port (unlike hubs).</li>
                        <li><strong>Supports Full-Duplex:</strong> Allows simultaneous data send/receive for faster speeds.</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Types of Switches in Computer Network</h3>
                    <p>Switches in computer networks are devices that connect multiple devices (like computers, and printers) within a network. They manage data traffic efficiently by directing data only to the devices that need it, enhancing network performance. Unlike hubs, switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, making decisions based on MAC addresses. They are crucial for creating reliable and fast local area networks (LANs).</p>
                    
                    <p>Switches are the connectivity points of an Ethernet network. These are small devices that can receive data from multiple input ports and send it to the specific output port that takes data to its intended destination in the network.</p>

                    <h3>Mechanical Switches</h3>
                    <p>Mechanical switches are physical switches that you activate by physically moving, pressing, releasing, or touching their contacts. Mechanical switches come in different types depending on things like how they are activated (manual, limit, or process switches), how many contacts they have (single or multi-contact switches), the number of poles and throws (like SPST, DPDT, SPDT), their design and operation (push button, toggle, rotary, joystick), and whether they are momentary or locked.</p>

                    <h3>Introduction of Firewall</h3>
                    <p>A firewall is a network security device either hardware or software-based which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic. It acts like a security guard that helps keep your digital world safe from unwanted visitors and potential threats.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accept:</strong> allow the traffic</li>
                        <li><strong>Reject:</strong> block the traffic but reply with an "unreachable error"</li>
                        <li><strong>Drop:</strong> block the traffic with no reply</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A firewall is a type of network security device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic with security policies that have previously been set up inside an organization. A firewall is essentially the wall that separates a private internal network from the open Internet at its very basic level.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Need For Firewall</h3>
                    <p>Before Firewalls, network security was performed by Access Control Lists (ACLs) residing on routers. ACLs are rules that determine whether network access should be granted or denied to specific IP address. But ACLs cannot determine the nature of the packet it is blocking. Also, ACL alone does not have the capacity to keep threats out of the network. Hence, the Firewall was introduced.</p>
                    <p>Connectivity to the Internet is no longer optional for organizations. However, accessing the Internet provides benefits to the organization; it also enables the outside world to interact with the internal network of the organization. This creates a threat to the organization. In order to secure the internal network from unauthorized traffic, we need a Firewall.</p>

                    <h3>Working</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firewall match the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table. Once the rule is matched, associate action is applied to the network traffic. For example, Rules are defined as any employee from Human Resources department cannot access the data from code server and at the same time another rule is defined like system administrator can access the data from both Human Resource and technical department.</li>
                        <li>Rules can be defined on the firewall based on the necessity and security policies of the organization.</li>
                        <li>From the perspective of a server, network traffic can be either outgoing or incoming. Firewall maintains a distinct set of rules for both the cases. Mostly the outgoing traffic, originated from the server itself, allowed to pass. Still, setting a rule on outgoing traffic is always better in order to achieve more security and prevent unwanted communication. Incoming traffic is treated differently.</li>
                        <li>Most traffic which reaches on the firewall is one of these three major Transport Layer protocols- TCP, UDP or ICMP. All these types have a source address and destination address. Also, TCP and UDP have port numbers. ICMP uses type code instead of port number which identifies purpose of that packet.</li>

                        <div class="firewall-type">
                            <h4>1. Packet Filtering Firewall</h4>
                            <p>Packet filtering firewall is used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or stop based on source and destination IP address, protocols, and ports. It analyses traffic at the transport protocol layer (but mainly uses first 3 layers). Packet firewalls treat each packet in isolation. They have no ability to tell whether a packet is part of an existing stream of traffic. Only It can allow or deny the packets based on unique packet headers.</p>
                            <p>Packet filtering firewall maintains a filtering table that decides whether the packet will be forwarded or discarded. From the given filtering table, the packets will be filtered according to the following rules:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Incoming packets from network 192.168.21.0 are blocked.</li>
                                <li>Incoming packets destined for the internal TELNET server (port 23) are blocked.</li>
                                <li>Incoming packets destined for host 192.168.21.3 are blocked.</li>
                                <li>All well-known services to the network 192.168.21.0 are allowed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h4>2. Stateful Inspection Firewall</h4>
                            <p>Stateful firewalls (performs Stateful Packet Inspection) are able to determine the connection state of packet, unlike Packet filtering firewall, which makes it more efficient. It keeps track of the state of networks connection travelling across it, such as TCP streams. So the filtering decisions would not only be based on defined rules, but also on packet's history in the state table.</p>

                            <h4>3. Application Layer Firewall</h4>
                            <p>Application layer firewall can inspect and filter the packets on any OSI layer, up to the application layer. It has the ability to block specific content, also recognize when certain application and protocols (like HTTP, FTP) are being misused. In other words, Application layer firewalls are hosts that run proxy servers. A proxy firewall prevents the direct connection between either side of the firewall, each packet has to pass through the proxy.</p>

                    <h3>What is Antivirus Software?</h3>
                    <p>Antivirus software (computer protection software) is a program(s) that is created to search, detect, prevent and remove software viruses from your system that can harm your system. Other harmful software such as worms, adware, and other threats can also be detected and removed via antivirus. This software is designed to be used as a proactive approach to cyber security, preventing threats from entering your computer and causing issues. Most antivirus software operates in the background once installed, providing real-time protection against virus attacks.</p>
                    <p>While you may believe that your computer is safe as long as you don't visit questionable websites, hackers have far more sophisticated methods of infecting your computer, which is why you need a powerful antivirus to stay to secure your data and system. The implications of a virus getting into your computer might be fatal. Viruses can cause a wide range of malicious behaviour. They can crash your device, monitor your accounts, or spy on you through your webcam. So, always use antivirus software.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
                    <p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, so does the risk of cybercrime for mobile phones, laptops, smart home devices, and other internet-connected devices. According to the 2023 Cost of Data Breach Study by IBM, the average cost of a data breach involving mobile devices is $1.9 million. You need to protect yourself against malware by using strong passwords, keeping your devices up to date, and being careful about what apps you download.</p>
                    <p>The three most common types of cyber threats are –</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Malware</li>
                        <li>Spyware</li>
                        <li>Phishing</li>

                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>How Antivirus Works?</h3>
                    <p>Antivirus software works by comparing your computer applications and files to a database of known malware kinds. Because hackers are continually creating and disseminating new viruses, they will also check systems for the presence of new or undiscovered malware threats. The antivirus checks files, programs, and applications going in and out of your computer to its database to identify matches. Similar and identical matches to the database are segregated, scanned, and eliminated.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most Antivirus programs will employ these four types of detection techniques:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Signature detection</strong> is a method by which an antivirus keenly scans files that are brought into a system to analyze more likely hazardous files.</li>
                        <li><strong>Specific detection</strong>, which looks for known parts or types of malware or patterns that are linked by a common codebase</li>
                        <li><strong>Generic detection</strong> is a type of detection that looks for known parts or types of malware or patterns that are related to a common codebase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heuristic detection</strong> is a type of virus detection that looks for unknown infections by spotting suspicious file structures.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3>Examples of Antivirus Software</h3>
                    <p>The antivirus software is available in 2 types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free:</strong> Free anti-virus software provides basic virus protection</li>

                    <h3>What Is a VPN?</h3>
                    <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. It essentially acts as a private tunnel for your internet traffic, preventing hackers, ISPs, and even governments from monitoring your activities. When using a VPN, your IP address is masked, and your online actions are routed through a remote server, making it harder to track your online activity.</p>
                    
                    <div class="vpn-benefits">
                        <h4>Key Benefits of Using a VPN:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> A VPN hides your IP address, ensuring that your browsing habits and activities remain private.</li>
                            <li><strong>Security on Public Networks:</strong> Public Wi-Fi networks are often insecure, but a VPN encrypts your connection, making it safer to browse the internet on networks like those in cafes or airports.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bypass Geo-restrictions:</strong> A VPN allows you to access content that may be blocked in certain regions (such as streaming platforms, social media sites, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Prevent Data Throttling:</strong> Some ISPs throttle your connection speed when you stream or play games. A VPN can bypass this, allowing for faster internet speeds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessing Remote Work Resources:</strong> A VPN enables secure access to private networks, making it ideal for businesses and remote workers.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3>How Does a VPN Work</h3>
                    <p>A VPN works by creating an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server. Here's the process simplified:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Connection Establishment:</strong> When you activate a VPN on your device, it connects to a server operated by the VPN provider.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The VPN encrypts your data (information, files, web traffic) so that it's unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it, whether it's a hacker on the same Wi-Fi network or an entity trying to monitor your browsing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic Redirection:</strong> Your device's internet traffic is routed through the VPN server, which can be located in any country. This makes it appear as though you're browsing from the server's location, masking your actual IP address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decryption:</strong> Once your data reaches the VPN server, it is decrypted and sent to the destination (such as a website, app, or service). Any response from the server is then sent back to you through the encrypted tunnel.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
